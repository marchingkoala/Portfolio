# Personal Portfolio Website

Using the html template provided by HTML5 UP, I quickly built a personal portfolio website. 

The original code was purely written in html with jquery, but I wanted to gain speed and organize codes more effectively by implementing React by Vite. 

The overhaul involved deep diving into the numerous lines of code and disecting them in to different compartments if necessary.

I personalized the website using the original frame by editing CSS attributes and adding images.
